# Git commit / push requests

When the user asks for "git commit code", "push to git", "full push command", or similar, **always** provide the full sequence:

1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`
3. `git push origin <branch>`

Include all three (and optionally a one-liner). Only deviate if you know of a specific issue (e.g. no remote, merge conflict, they asked for something different).

Default branch in the push command can be `main` unless the repo uses another default.
