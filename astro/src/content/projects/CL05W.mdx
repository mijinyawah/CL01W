I used to have a Lychee gallery for my motorcycle group which was hosted on my personal NAS which worked great until it didn't (power outages, codebase issues I couldn't solve, etc). I'd love to see if Codex can vibe code up a photo gallery that is more reliable but equally useful to use. Results TBD.
