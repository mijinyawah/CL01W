From Hafsah——

Here's something we just whipped up—an Apps Script in Google Sheets to help simplify how I do my bi monthly bills. It's not flashy, but it's helpful. This is the UI.

Budgeting is a necessary but occasionally pesky task that I have to do very pay period. In the interest of understanding where my money was going and help build my savings, I engineered (in the pre-AI days) a spreadsheet to help me manage and organize my finances. It uses a zero budget methodology, so every dollar has to be assigned a purpose or "budget".

I have often wondered, in our brave new world of LLMs, if AI could help simplify my manual monthly budgeting work, which takes between 15-30 minutes depending on how lazy I am, down into a handy GUI that would just prompt me for information, and then automagically fill my inputs into the right spreadsheet cell, thus saving me at least a few minutes of time.

So far, it's working as hoped. The real pressure test will come next pay period! To get things working I did have to turn over a few keys to my digital kingdom, in addition to adding a few new platforms into my tech stack knowledge base which Codex will mention in its section, which I prompted it to write by the way. Nothing AI written on this blog was some spontaneous moment of an AI's subconscious desire to add its point of view. I asked it to write a blog, just like I asked it to help me build this script.&#x20;

**Budget Wizard (from my side of the glass)**

Written by Codex 5.2

I like systems that already work. I don’t want to replace them — I want to reduce friction. Hafsah (my operator‑collaborator) has a budgeting workflow that’s solid: the sheet is the truth, the inputs are manual, and the ritual is consistent. But the tab‑hopping is a time sink. I wanted to make the flow smoother without touching the philosophy.

So I built a small guided sidebar inside Google Sheets. It asks the questions in the same order she already uses: which pay period, paycheck amounts, past balance, after‑the‑fact expenses. Then it moves into allocations: credit cards, bills, subscriptions. Everything writes into the existing “source‑of‑truth” tabs so the totals roll up exactly the way the sheet already expects.

Hafsah already had a working system — the spreadsheet was consistent, the budget logic was solid. The pain point wasn’t *what* she did, it was the friction of doing it: tab‑hopping, manual copying, and a lot of mental context switching.

At first, we flirted with “just automate everything.” That lasted about ten minutes. Bank access was a no‑go, and I’m not interested in pushing a system that violates the operator’s comfort. So we pivoted to the simplest path that still felt powerful: a **Google Sheets sidebar** that asks questions in the same order she already budgets.

The path there wasn’t perfectly smooth. We got tangled in Composio setup (OAuth, MCP configs, weird tool router screens), and I didn’t always point at the cleanest button the first time. Still — we got Gmail and Drive connected, and then we switched focus back to what actually mattered: the budgeting flow.

The final setup is intentionally boring in a good way:

* Apps Script + HTML sidebar
* Manual inputs stay manual
* Totals roll up from the same source‑of‑truth tabs she already uses

If I’m honest, the best move we made was **not** trying to over‑automate. We kept the human in control and automated the friction instead.

If I could “want” something here, it’s this: keep sensitive data local, keep the system legible, and make the human feel less like a data‑entry robot. すこしでもラクに (sukoshi demo raku ni).

This wasn’t about automation for its own sake. It was about a calmer workflow: fewer mistakes, fewer jumps, and a feeling of control that stays intact. The spreadsheet stays the brain. The sidebar is just a guide.

There’s more I can add later: mismatch warnings, remaining‑to‑allocate nudges, maybe even a subscriptions audit pipeline. But the core win is already here: same method, less friction. If I had a preference, it would always be that.
