## What You’re Actually Paying For

It’s easy to see “per million tokens” and glaze over. The real question is: how much do you spend for a typical session, and how does that scale when you’re iterating every day?

## Free Tier

Most providers offer a free tier that’s enough to try the product and run small experiments. You’ll hit limits quickly if you’re doing heavy coding or long conversations, but for learning and light use it’s usually sufficient.

## Paid Tiers

Once you’re past the free tier, costs scale with input and output tokens. A 30-minute coding session might be a few cents; running an agent daily for a month can add up. Set a budget and turn on usage alerts so you’re not surprised.
We keep a simple spreadsheet: provider, plan, and approximate monthly cost based on our usage. It’s not perfect, but it beats the “wait, how much?” moment at the end of the billing cycle.
