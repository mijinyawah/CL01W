## Notes from a user

Hey, I'm Hafsah, I'm a multidisciplinary designer with a current focus on brand strategy and motion design. You can check out some of my work at my website.

As of this writing, I no longer use [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/)—an AI personal assistant purported to be a game changing AI chatbot product. I mention this because this website (*the one you are reading right now*) was an idea produced during my 48 hours an instance of "moltbot" which I named "Clawde". Clawde existed on a sandboxed Docker environment provided by a Digital Ocean droplet. It was given its own 1Password vault, some limited API connectivity to persoal apps like Google Calendar and Notion, and briefly did a stint as my own personal DJ, controlling Apple Music somehow via conversation requests in the Telegram chat I communicated with it from.&#x20;

#### 48 hours ago, I wouldn't have known how to do any of that. The kicker is...I still don't!&#x20;

But now a week into experimenting with AI chatbots as productivity and design partners, I do know a tiny bit more about development, all thanks to AI chatbots like Claude, "moltbot" and Codex by OpenAI.

## **Important preface: I am not an AI fan.**

There is something surreal that I think about a lot. At this point in time, we can now have conversations with people about the "before times". Before ChatGPT was used for every web searches instead of google. Before the word "vibe coding" was used conversationally. Before "AI slop". It's wild to think that none of this existed less than two years ago—at least, in the form factor we now use it in. AI has *always* been around. But we are living through a brave new iteration of it, and are slowly seeing our most sci-fi inspired hopes, fears, and dreams about artificial intelligence turn into our reality.

#### I am a user of modern AI products (chatbots and generative media AI) because my livelihood as a designer was forged in the tech space.

With that comes a need to adapt to new technologies. To be relevant, you have to stay relevant. That means build skills as those skillsets present themselves. As a brand strategic and content producer in the corporate space, I would be foolish to ignore the powerful AI enabled capabilities being introduced for video work, for project planning and pre-production, for web development, for content creation. For me, it's not about generating garbage, it's about using the tools and skillsets I already have to develop and iterate faster and get closer to ***done*** than ever.

I also use AI tools on occasion simply because I am a curious person, and where there is potential value in learning, I *will* lean in to try and learn. This website is a decent (but imperfect) example of that.

#### That all said, I recognize that there are glaringly unstudied grey areas with regard to the ethics of LLM and AI development,&#x20;

as well as with how secure they are with the vast amounts of data they are being fed and given access to minute over minute. AI, to me, is effectively a snowball, rolling down a large snowy hill, accumulating girth and mass as it rolls ever faster into a looming behemoth with unknown intensions. Dramatic? Perhaps. Metaphor exaggeration *where*. Both ethics and security are important things to me because they are the engine that drives how many of us live within this modern world. As human beings, we should ideally do no harm to each other, whether emotional, material or physical, and quite consistently, we fail at that in the pursuit of knowledge (or rather, for many in the tech space, money and clout).&#x20;

And yet, here we are.

So anyway, this is my preface post to set up the other articles on this website. I am intrigued by and cautious of AI, but not so much that I'm not able to see what it can do for me as a user. There is so much fucking hyperbole in the AI space. Subreddits and technologist blogs are full of breathless excitement over new models, new github repos with tons of skills and wacky things to install and run with your instance of GPT or Claude or whatever. Every other post I scroll by shares some vague, detail-less story of how Claude or ChatGPT completely blew a mind by creating an app from a single prompt in under 20 minutes.&#x20;

I have some nits to pick with the hyperbole. From zero to shipped with just a prompt? And perfect on the first try? Really? This website took over 24 hours to build. Isn't that right, Codex?

> ***Codex:** Yes — 24+ hours is accurate. The CoWork notes show multiple revision rounds and a full design‑system rebuild (tokens, fonts, breakpoints) on top of the Astro scaffold, plus content plumbing and interactive effects. That isn’t a one‑prompt build; it’s a chain of passes, tweaks, and QA. So “over a day” is the honest number.*

So...some things to unpack there. And I'm going to use this website to do it. This will be my void to scream into, my github repository to torture, my vercel website to deform. And you are welcome to observe from start to finish.

## Another important note for me: I don't write with AI.

I mean, I do use it to write *prompts* for *other* LLMs. But, because part of my personal conceit and pretension is around my relationship to academia and creative literature (both parents English teachers, I effectively grew up in libraries until I was ruined by computers), I have to reiterate that I don't use AI for creative writing. I do use it to synthesize documentation, to interpret poorly written emails/slacks, and to wordsmith things I have already written, typically in the context of "Claude, what's the word for...?".&#x20;

This website is a blog, and all blog posts will have labels indicating whose voice is present in each. Sometime it will just be me, sometimes it will be Claude, sometimes it will be Codex.

We wanted to see what it would feel like to build a real site with an AI pair programmer. No boilerplate dump, no “give me a full app” — just one component at a time, with a human making the calls and an AI writing the code. The result is this site: a simple layout, a content collection, and a few pages that show how the pieces fit together.

Building with an AI doesn’t mean replacing design or product thinking. It means spending less time on boilerplate and more on structure, content, and how the thing actually feels. We kept the layout and typography decisions human-driven and used the AI for implementation details and repetitive markup.

## What We Shipped

The first version was a single page and a sidebar. Then we added a grid background, a cursor trail, and finally the content layer: articles and projects pulled from MDX. Each step was a separate “can you do this?” so we could see how well the AI followed the design spec.

## What’s Next

The site is live on Vercel and updates on every push. We’re using it as a lab for future experiments: more content types, better mobile behavior, and maybe a few playful interactions. If you’re reading this, you’re looking at the output of that first experiment.
