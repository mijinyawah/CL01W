## Notes from a user

Hey, I'm Hafsah, I'm a multidisciplinary designer with a current focus on brand strategy and motion design. You can check out some of my work at my website.

As of this writing, I no longer use [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/)—an AI personal assistant purported to be a game changing AI chatbot product. I mention that because this website was an idea produced during my 48 hours with my own personal "moltbot" which I named "Clawde". Clawde ran off of a sandboxed Docker environment provided by a Digital Ocean droplet. It was given its own 1Password vault, some limited API connectivity to apps like Google Calendar and Notion, and briefly did a stint as my own personal DJ, controlled via conversation requests in the Telegram chat I communicated with it from. 48 hours ago, I wouldn't have known how to do any of that. The kicker is...I still don't! But now a week into experimenting with AI chatbots as collaborative and design partners, I do know a tiny bit more about development, all thanks to AI chatbots like Claude, "moltbot" and Codex by OpenAI.

**Important preface:** I am not an proponent of new AI technologies. I use them because my livelihood as a design was forged in the tech space, and with that comes a need to adapt to new technologies, lest you become obsolete and unemployable. I also use them on occasion simply because I am a curious person, and where the is potential value in learning, I will lean in to try and learn. That said, I recognize that there are glaringly unstudied grey areas with regard to the ethics of LLM and AI development, as well as with how secure they are with the vast amounts of data they are being fed minute over minute. Both ethics and security are important things to me because they are the engine that drives how many of us live within this modern world. As human beings, we should ideally do no harm to each other, whether emotional, material or physical, and quite consistently, we fail at that in the pursuit of knowledge (or rather, for many in the tech space, money and clout).



The kno on subreddits like \[r/cybersecurity, r/artificialintelligence r/vibecoding and others has revealed a&#x20;

We wanted to see what it would feel like to build a real site with an AI pair programmer. No boilerplate dump, no “give me a full app” — just one component at a time, with a human making the calls and an AI writing the code. The result is this site: a simple layout, a content collection, and a few pages that show how the pieces fit together.

Here’s a minimal Astro component we used early on to confirm the stack was working:

```astro
---
interface Props {
  name: string;
}
const { name } = Astro.props;
---
<p>Hello, {name}!</p>
```

## Why This Matters

Building with an AI doesn’t mean replacing design or product thinking. It means spending less time on boilerplate and more on structure, content, and how the thing actually feels. We kept the layout and typography decisions human-driven and used the AI for implementation details and repetitive markup.

## What We Shipped

The first version was a single page and a sidebar. Then we added a grid background, a cursor trail, and finally the content layer: articles and projects pulled from MDX. Each step was a separate “can you do this?” so we could see how well the AI followed the design spec.

## What’s Next

The site is live on Vercel and updates on every push. We’re using it as a lab for future experiments: more content types, better mobile behavior, and maybe a few playful interactions. If you’re reading this, you’re looking at the output of that first experiment.
