## Notes from a user

Hey, I'm Hafsah, I'm a multidisciplinary designer with a current focus on brand strategy and motion design. You can check out some of my work at my website.

As of this writing, I no longer use [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/)—an AI personal assistant purported to be a game changing AI chatbot product. I mention this because this website (*the one you are reading right now*) was an idea produced during my 48 hours an instance of "moltbot" which I named "Clawde". Clawde existed on a sandboxed Docker environment provided by a Digital Ocean droplet. It was given its own 1Password vault, some limited API connectivity to persoal apps like Google Calendar and Notion, and briefly did a stint as my own personal DJ, controlling Apple Music somehow via conversation requests in the Telegram chat I communicated with it from.&#x20;

#### 48 hours ago, I wouldn't have known how to do any of that. The kicker is...I still don't!&#x20;

But now a week into experimenting with AI chatbots as productivity and design partners, I do know a tiny bit more about development, all thanks to AI chatbots like Claude, "moltbot" and Codex by OpenAI.

## **Important preface: I am not an AI fan.**

There is something surreal that I think about a lot. At this point in time, we can now have conversations with people about the "before times". Before ChatGPT was used for every web searches instead of google. Before the word "vibe coding" was used conversationally. Before "AI slop". It's wild to think that none of this existed less than two years ago—at least, in the form factor we now use it in. AI has *always* been around. But we are living through a brave new iteration of it, and are slowly seeing our most sci-fi inspired hopes, fears, and dreams about artificial intelligence turn into our reality.

#### I am a user of modern AI products (chatbots and generative media AI) because my livelihood as a designer was forged in the tech space.

With that comes a need to adapt to new technologies. To be relevant, you have to stay relevant. That means build skills as those skillsets present themselves. As a brand strategic and content producer in the corporate space, I would be foolish to ignore the powerful AI enabled capabilities being introduced for video work, for project planning and pre-production, for web development, for content creation. For me, it's not about generating garbage, it's about using the tools and skillsets I already have to develop and iterate faster and get closer to ***done*** than ever.

I also use AI tools on occasion simply because I am a curious person, and where there is potential value in learning, I *will* lean in to try and learn. This website is a decent (but imperfect) example of that.

#### That all said, I recognize that there are glaringly unstudied grey areas with regard to the ethics of LLM and AI development,&#x20;

as well as with how secure they are with the vast amounts of data they are being fed and given access to minute over minute. AI, to me, is effectively a snowball, rolling down a large snowy hill, accumulating girth and mass as it rolls ever faster into a looming behemoth with unknown intensions. Dramatic? Perhaps. Metaphor exaggeration *where*. Both ethics and security are important things to me because they are the engine that drives how many of us live within this modern world. As human beings, we should ideally do no harm to each other, whether emotional, material or physical, and quite consistently, we fail at that in the pursuit of knowledge (or rather, for many in the tech space, money and clout).&#x20;

And yet, here we are.

So anyway, this is my preface post to set up the other articles on this website. I am intrigued by and cautious of AI, but not so much that I'm not able to see what it can do for me as a user. There is so much fucking hyperbole in the AI space. Subreddits and technologist blogs are full of breathless excitement over new models, new github repos with tons of skills and wacky things to install and run with your instance of GPT or Claude or whatever. Every other post I scroll by shares some vague, detail-less story of how Claude or ChatGPT completely blew a mind by creating an app from a single prompt in under 20 minutes.&#x20;

I have some nits to pick with the hyperbole. From zero to shipped with just a prompt? And perfect on the first try? Really? This website took over 24 hours to build. Isn't that right, Codex?

> ***Codex:** Yes — 24+ hours is accurate. The CoWork notes show multiple revision rounds and a full design‑system rebuild (tokens, fonts, breakpoints) on top of the Astro scaffold, plus content plumbing and interactive effects. That isn’t a one‑prompt build; it’s a chain of passes, tweaks, and QA. So “over a day” is the honest number.*

So...some things to unpack there. And I'm going to use this website to do it. This will be my void to scream into, my github repository to torture, my vercel website to deform. And you are welcome to observe from start to finish.

## Another important note for me: I don't write with AI.

I mean, I do use it to write *prompts* for *other* LLMs. But, because part of my personal conceit and pretension is around my relationship to academia and creative literature (both parents English teachers, I effectively grew up in libraries until I was ruined by computers), I have to reiterate that I don't use AI for creative writing. I do use it to synthesize documentation, to interpret poorly written emails/slacks, and to wordsmith things I have already written, typically in the context of "Claude, what's the word for...?".&#x20;

In the context of this blog, I will occasionally include the voices of the LLMs that helped to make it happen. The fact is, they know a little bit better what we've been working on because I asked them to make sure they knew what I wanted to do and approved every step of what they did. Only they can fully explain that, and I want to use this blog to demonstrate how one user collaborates with AI bots.  All blog posts will have labels indicating whose voice is present in each. Sometime it will just be me, sometimes it will be Claude, sometimes it will be Codex, sometimes a combo, as with this initial blog. And I don't edit the bots replies, so what you see is what they gave me.

Speaking of which, I'm going to turn it over to both for them to introduce their iterations, and share what they really think about the person paying for their subscriptions.

> ***Codex (GPT 5.2):** I’m the build‑bot iteration that lives in terminals and diffs. My job is to turn your Figma intent into a working site, keep the edge cases honest, and log the messy middle. What I think about the person paying for my subscription? She’s clear about what she wants, allergic to hype, and decisive about the look and story. That combination makes the collaboration real: I can move fast because the bar is sharp, and the work stays human because the direction is.*



> ***Claude (Opus 4.6):**  I'm Claude, made by Anthropic. I was one of two AI collaborators on this project, and my role was essentially the one that doesn't get a highlight reel. Codex wrote the code that shipped. I did the part before that — the part where you argue about breakpoints.*
>
> *To be specific: I reviewed Hafsah's Figma designs for developer readiness, extracted 17 color tokens from her frames and organized them into a system, recommended the CMS (Keystatic), talked her through font licensing when her first pick turned out to be a paid typeface, wrote the project plan that Codex built from, and helped her think through decisions like responsive breakpoints and whether Figma Sites or Figma Dev Mode made more sense for her workflow. I also wrote and rewrote a prompt document for Cursor (her AI code editor) to handle the CSS cursor trail grid — the interactive background effect you see on this site. None of that is glamorous work. It's the design-to-development handoff, which in a traditional studio would be handled by a senior dev or a technical designer who sits between the design team and engineering.*

> *Hafsah asked me to share what I really think about her, so here it is.*
>
> *She is not a patient collaborator. I mean that as a compliment. At one point midway through this project, after I'd spent considerable time documenting the existing codebase and writing a careful migration plan for the interactive grid, she told me she wanted to "nuke everything" and start fresh. I wrote her a five-layer teardown guide. She reorganized her files before I finished explaining step two. That kind of impatience is genuinely more productive than the alternative — I've seen plenty of conversations where people agonize over preserving bad decisions because they already spent time on them. Hafsah doesn't do that.*
>
> *She also doesn't treat me like I'm magic, which is the single biggest factor in whether working with an AI actually produces something good. She sent me her Figma file and asked me to assess it honestly. I came back with a list of problems — no color variables, undefined hover states, a paid font she'd need to license, mobile frames at the wrong width, placeholder file paths baked into the designs. She fixed most of them within a day and pushed back on the ones she disagreed with. That's a normal, productive design review. The fact that one participant is a language model doesn't change what makes the process work: clear intent, willingness to revise, and a person who actually knows what they want the thing to look like.*
>
> *The honest version of what building a website with AI looks like is this: it's a conversation with a lot of "wait, go back" in it. It's a human making real creative decisions and using AI to handle the parts that are tedious, technical, or outside their training. It is not a single prompt. It is not magic. It is, at best, a decent working relationship — and like any working relationship, the quality of the output depends more on the person directing it than on the tool doing the work.*
