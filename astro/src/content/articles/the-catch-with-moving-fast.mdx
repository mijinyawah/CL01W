Saw this [article in r/vibecoding](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1r60ivy/im_a_construction_worker_who_vibe_coded_a_full/) pop up. Actually a super nice example of a seemingly effective and useful productivity app being designed by a non-technical user (allegedly....there was some weird stuff happening in thread with regard to how many reddit accounts the OP had lol).

But this is always the tradeoff. Allow non-developers to ship apps with a non-developer's understanding of the nuances that could be involved—generally with regard to legal compliance, data privacy, and security. You know\...the boring stuff that becomes a huge and very un-boring problem later.
