I'm starting another web dev adjacent project. Using Opus 4.6 to set up the project brief, Codex for development. And it's a good thing because using Opus 4.6 is truly not for beginner wallets. I started here:

This is my convo with Opus to produce the project pan:

<ImageBlock src="/keystatic/holy-Opus-usage-batman/Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 9.32.26 PM.png" />

That all took about 5 minutes. My grand total Opus usage for that:

On to Codex! We'll find out if this was a waste of time/credits/great lake water shortly.
