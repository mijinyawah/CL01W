## The Basics

When you plug an AI agent into your workflow, you’re giving it access to data: your files, your APIs, sometimes your credentials. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use it — it means you should treat it like any other tool that touches sensitive information. A few simple habits go a long way.

Never paste API keys or passwords into a chat. Use environment variables and let the agent reference them by name. Restrict keys to the minimum scope they need (read-only where possible), and rotate them if you think they’ve been exposed. For projects that run code, run it in a sandbox or a separate account so a mistake doesn’t blow up your main environment.

Here’s a minimal example of how we keep secrets out of the repo:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "API_KEY": "${API_KEY}",
    "PUBLIC_MODE": "read-only"
  }
}
```

## Stay in Control

The goal isn’t to avoid AI — it’s to use it without giving away the keys to the kingdom. Start with non-sensitive tasks, see how the agent behaves, and only then expand what you allow it to do.
